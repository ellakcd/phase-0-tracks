		<h1>  Rain Rain Go Away</h1>
		<p> Today it is raining and I am less than pleased about this fact for a <strong>number</strong> of reasons :(</p>
		<ol> 
			<li> I was planning to spend the day outside </li>
			<li> I forgot to bring a hat </li>
			<li> It is supposed to rain <a href = "https://www.weather.com"> all weekend</a> </li>
		</ol>

		<p> There are <em>so many</em> types of weather I prefer :) </p>
		<ul> 
		<li> Snow! </li>
		<li> Fog! </li>
		<li> Sunshine! </li>
		</ul>
