What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
There are nine major tenets to the Linux philosophy.

Small is Beautiful
Each Program Does One Thing Well
Prototype as Soon as Possible
Choose Portability Over Efficiency
Store Data in Flat Text Files
Use Software Leverage
Use Shell Scripts to Increase Leverage and Portability
Avoid Captive User Interfaces
Make Every Program a Filter
(that's in their words, not mine!)

building simple, short, clear, modular, and extensible code that can be easily maintained and repurposed by developers other than its creators. The Unix philosophy favors composability as opposed to monolithic design.
(also not my words!)

Basically, they want things to be simple, small, and broken down into the smallest parts for clarity. 

In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

It seems like VPS hosting a combo between shared hosting and dedicated hosting, where you share the physical machine but have you own cordoned off private part.  It's good because it's cheaper than dedicated hosting, you can select features based on your needs, and you can more control than with shared hosting, but the same access to resources and help.  

Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
it keeps your computer secure from malicious web pages and apps!
