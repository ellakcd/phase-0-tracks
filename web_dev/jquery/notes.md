PLAN: 
I've only got 3 hours right now, so that will provide a good artificial limit! 

I will google / wikipedia first to get an overview of what jquery is

Then I will look through the docs for a more specific understanding

I haven't been using Youtube as a resource, but maybe i'll try that if I feel stuck

I'm not a big break taker, so I'll probably power through

Whenever I feel like I have grasp of a new concept, I'll quickly test my understanding of it, but not spend extraneous time building, right now





I found that when I started googling with no idea what to google, I didn't get anywhere, so I devoted about 20 minutes to quickly working through the first few units of codeacademy so I knew where to begin and had some context. 

I then googled to much more avail.  

I found digitalocean a really good and clear source - it was the only one that explicitly told me how to do the setup, which is what I often have the most trouble intuitively figuring out.  

After that, I found jquery fundementals to be helpful!

It took me a while to figure out where to even start looking, so once I'd figured out setup, elements, events, I was pretty much out of time for actually making something cool.  But I think I have a hang of the basics now.
