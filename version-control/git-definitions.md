# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	version control is the method by which you can track all the changes you make to a project, revert back to any step along the way, and have multiple people work on the same project at the same time.  It is useful because it provides a clear record of what has been done and who has done it.  It also helps with efficency.  
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	A branch is like a subproject within a bigger project.  You use one if you want to focus on a specific smaller feature and then apply those changes back to the main project later.  
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	A commit is when you update your repo with the changes you've made.  A good message is clear and concise and reminds you and others what exactly got changed at this point.  
* What is a merge conflict?
	a merge conflict is what two people try to cmerge files that have been altered in ways that are mutually exclusive and the computer doesn't know which one to listen to.
